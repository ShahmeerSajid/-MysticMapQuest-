# MysticMapQuest: Your Epic (and Slightly Ridiculous) Treasure Hunt!

Ahoy, adventurer! Welcome to MysticMapQuest, the game where you’re a treasure-hunting, map-decoding mastermind (or at least you pretend to be). Armed with nothing but a cryptic 2D map, a few arrows, and sheer determination, you’ll embark on a journey to collect shiny treasures while trying not to trip over your own breadcrumbs. Sound easy? Well, it’s not. But it’s definitely fun!
