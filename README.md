# MysticMapQuest: Your Epic (and Slightly Ridiculous) Treasure Hunt!
MysticMapQuest is a quirky Python treasure hunt! Dive into random 2D maps, grab shiny treasures (+), and dodge your own tracks (X). Navigate with arrows (&lt;, >, v, ^), and explore every playthrough's wild new adventure. Ready to find that hidden loot?

Ahoy, adventurer! Welcome to MysticMapQuest, the game where you’re a treasure-hunting, map-decoding mastermind (or at least you pretend to be). Armed with nothing but a cryptic 2D map, a few arrows, and sheer determination, you’ll embark on a journey to collect shiny treasures while trying not to trip over your own breadcrumbs. Sound easy? Well, it’s not. But it’s definitely fun!
